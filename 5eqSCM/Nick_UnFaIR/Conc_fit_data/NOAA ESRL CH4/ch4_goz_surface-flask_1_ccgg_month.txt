# comment:  
# comment: These data are made freely available to the public and the
# comment: scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination
# comment: will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights.
# comment: The availability of these data does not constitute publication
# comment: of the data.  NOAA relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to
# comment: ensure that ESRL receives fair credit for their work.  If the data 
# comment: are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation,

# comment: may be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in
# comment: the work.  Manuscripts using the ESRL data should be sent to ESRL
# comment: for review before they are submitted for publication so we can
# comment: insure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately
# comment: represented.
# comment:  
# comment: Every effort is made to produce the most accurate and precise

# comment: of the ESRL data, namely well documented model code, transport
# comment: fields, and additional information necessary for other
# comment: scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions.
# comment: Model availability includes collaborative support for new
# comment: users of the models.
